A shape would appear shortly after the previous. It would have a random colour each time and also, they would appear in a random location on the canvas so that they would not just appear on top of each other in the same location. If I had had more time I would have developed my art further by possible adding more shapes of various sizes as I feel this would have added more depth to the art. Another thing would have been to have it so the shapes started off by appearing in various shades of red and when a key is pressed the shapes would change to different shades of green and have different keys to represent different colours.
